## Features

  * **Data Handling**: The app downloads, parses, and stores information in an SQL database, specifically when the database is empty. 
  * **Filtering and Search**: Users can filter or search based on essential criteria such as gender specifications (male, female, or both), wheelchair accessibility, and the presence of diaper changing tables (or only diaper changing tables without a toilet).
  * **Location-Based Services**: The app utilizes the current user location to display the nearest facilities, employing a convenient color-coded map representation based on the filtering criteria. It offers both a list view with distances and a map view.

  
The ToiletFinder App aims to streamline the search for public facilities, enhancing user convenience while offering a comprehensive and reliable resource for locating essential amenities within the city.
